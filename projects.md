# Projects

I have a number of projects that I jump back and forth between.
Below are my most recent projects along with a short summary.

## Scripting language

Designed to be powerful, familiar, easy to use, small, and embeddable.
I'm more interested in developing an ecosystem around the language,
with support for documentation generation like rust has,
an integrated development environment, package management, etc.

## MediaBee App

A mobile app which lets you sync and organize media.
A companion desktop app would let you sync files between your phone.
It would have support for different kinds of libraries: movies, tv shows,
music, ebook, graphic novels, etc.

## pupapp

A peer to peer application featuring portals (wikis, forums, blogs, and chatrooms).
Would support a public web gateway with read-only access to network.
Supports permissions and ownership within portals.
Modular data store framework to make adding new portal types easier.
